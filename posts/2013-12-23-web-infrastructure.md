## Understanding Web Infrastructure

At RBSavvy, a lot of our clients tend to be non-technical people.  We love this type of working.  We get the opportunity to develop outside the lines, without all the baggage of another developer telling you exactly how problems should be solved.  We also get the opportunity to teach our clients about the process of web development, web infrastructure, development technologies, etc.

We often get blank stares from our clients as we explain the intricies of infrastructure choices and development methodologies.  Our clients ask for more reading material, but we've not been ale to find great resources that explain the technical concepts of database servers, caching strategies, background worker processes, and REST APIs in a non-technical way.  This series aims to do that.
